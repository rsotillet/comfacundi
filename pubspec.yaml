  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/svg/
   - assets/pictures/
   - assets/videos/banner.mp4
   - assets/data/Turism.json
   - assets/data/Credit.json
   - assets/data/Agreements.json
   - assets/data/Living.json
   - assets/data/Deport.json
   - assets/data/Education.json
   - assets/data/Subsidy.json
   - assets/data/Job.json
   

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat/Montserrat-ExtraBold.ttf

        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat/Montserrat-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat/Montserrat-LightItalic.ttf
          style: italic
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat/Montserrat-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
  # fonts:
